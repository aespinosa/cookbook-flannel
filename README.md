# Flannel Cookbook

This is a library cookbook that provides resources for setting up
[flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) instances.

## Requirements

* Chef 12.5.0 or higher.
* Network accessible web server hosting the flannel binaries.

## Platform Support

Tested on the following platforms with test-kitchen:

* debian-8.4
* centos-7.2
* ubuntu-16.04

## Usage

* Add `depends 'flannel', '~> 0.3'` to your cookbook's `metadata.rb`.
* Use the resources shipped in this cookbook.

# Custom Resources

* `flannel_service`

## flannel_service

Downloads pre-compiled Go binaries of flanneld onto disk.

* The `:create` action downloads the pre-compiled go binary of flanneld onto
  disk.
* The `:configure` action connects to etcd and loads the flanneld configuration to
  it.
* The `:start` action runs flanneld as a systemd service

It has the following properties corresponding to
[flannel's commandline options](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#key-command-line-options)

* `public_ip`
* `etcd_endpoints`
* `etcd_prefix`
* `etcd_keyfile`
* `etcd_certfile`
* `etcd_cafile`
* `iface`
* `subnet_file`
* `ip_masq`
* `listen`
* `remote`
* `remote_keyfile`
* `remote_certfile`
* `networks`
* `v` or `log_level`

Another property called `config` corresponds to
[flannel's etcd-stored configuration](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#configuration)

Additionally, if you are using TLS with etcd, you can pass extra options to the
etcdctl tool using the `etcdctl_options` property

## Helper

The [libraries/subnet_parser.rb](libraries/subnet_parser.rb) file extends the
flannel_service resource to read and parse the subnet file.  An example
approach on integrating with the docker cookbook
is found in
[test/cookbooks/flannel_test/recipes/docker.rb](test/cookbooks/flannel_test/recipes/docker.rb).
